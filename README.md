Guidelines


1. Your code must follow python pep8 coding standards

http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

2. You must write basic unit test cases. We recommend using nose​.

3. It must have proper error ­handling. (We will run it on a real­ server)

4. You must follow packaging and distributing guidelines.
https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/distributing.html

5. Purpose of above tasks is to test your python skills. So feel free to make assumptions if needed. Make sure you mention all assumptions in ​readme.md​ file.

6. Make sure readme contains libraries you have used.

7. It will be useful if usage instructions are also provided to understand how you expect
your code to be used.
